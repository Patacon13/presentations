### Assenza Tomás
### Ducasse Valentina

???
Hi, I'm Valentina Ducasse and I study Systems Engineering at the UTN. Today we're going to talk about how's Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are immersed in society, and how does an Information Systems Engineer could work on projects based on these topics.

## "This is a little known fact technological about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made of words and enthusiasm."

Erin McKean

## "We used to dream about this stuff. Now we get to build it. It's pretty great."

Steve Jobs

???
Before we start, here there are some quotes about internet and general technology. IoT projects have indeed a big value to society, but they also are inside the systems engineering scope, so a student or graduate of the UTN could work on these.

# Agenda

1. **Introduction**
2. How does it work
3. IoT and Systems Engineering


???
These are the topics that we'll talk about. I'll start with an introduction explaining what's Internet of Things is and how does it start to be used in society. After that, Irina will show how IoT works and some common characteristics that projects related to this area usually have. Finally, Tomás will talk about some projects that students and graduates of Information Systems Engineering can do.

# Introduction


???
To get started, we'll talk about what's IoT on theory.

Internet of Things is a concept that, in most cases, involves technological objects that weren't automated and can be updated to be "Smart". We can say that an object is smart when it starts to work similarly to a computer, often they even can connect to the Internet.

A device that has Internet of Things usually has sensors, software, hardware, and other technologies intending to connect and share data with devices all over the world. With the hardware, it can involve Artificial Intelligence. The most common use of AI is over voice recognition or object and pattern detection with an integrated camera.

???

Internet of Things appeared for the first time when the internet even didn't exist! Coca-Cola designed in 1982 a vending machine that used a board to detect the internal LEDs of the machine and used Arpanet (a precursor of internet) to send data to the main computer.

The funny thing about the creation of this device is that Mike Kazar (who's one of the creators) never used the machine except for trying to test if it worked. He said that he never liked Coke!

# How does it work


???
Now that we talked about what's IoT, I'm going to pass the control to Irina, so she can tell us more about this.

Hi! My name's Irina Argañaras and I'm also a Student of Systems Engineering at the UTN. Today I'm going to talk about the technical part of IoT. As Valentina said, Internet of Things involves software and hardware to generate a product, but some technologies are usually used on this type of project.

???
All the projects in the IoT area implement similar functions, so, to help developers to work with similar technologies, the companies that generate IoT solutions usually give them APIs to work with their products.

.center[![Diagrama open-weather](./imagenes/diagrama.png)]

???
An API is something between the technical development that the programmer does and the product that the company offers. In other words, the APIs help the Systems Engineer to create IoT software using existing technology.

???
As an example, we can have an IoT system to control the thermostat temperature. To do that, the IoT system can connect to the OpenWeather API, and obtain information about the weather. Also can use long term data with the preferences of the user, to offer a unique service to each user.
Also, the companies of public services could have the ability to analyze customer IoT data with smart thermostats to optimize the system on a large scale.

???
In IoT, there are a lot of projects with different costs. An example of expensive projects could be a smart home (pasar diapositiva), or the famous "Spot" robot (pasar diapositiva).

But not all projects need to be expensive. Some companies (like Google or Microsoft) started to build hardware for open-source implementations letting developers from all over the world work with IoT projects involving Artificial Intelligence with less than fifty dollars.

In IoT, the projects have very different costs. An example of expensive projects could be a smart home (pasar diapositiva) or the famous "Spot" robot (pasar diapositiva).

But not all projects need to be expensive. Some companies (like Google or Microsoft) started to build hardware for open-source implementations letting developers from all over the world work with IoT projects involving Artificial Intelligence with less than fifty bucks.

]

???
There are a lot of devices that help to implement IoT for engineers, or even enthusiasts. They usually work as a normal computer with its operating system. A good example of this type of device is the Raspberry PI that is a low-cost computer with similar capabilities to a cheap smartphone. It even has its own recommended operating system called Raspbian.

???
So, in other words, this extends the IoT concept to low-cost areas. It's a matter of fact that there are expensive projects like pre-build smart-homes, but there's a possibility to build IoT projects using other technologies designed to build very innovative ideas such as a voice detection system for turning lights on and off or a motion detection system for intrusion detection.

# IoT and Systems Engineering

???
Irina: Now Tomás is going to show how we can work on IoT projects as Systems Engineers.

Tomás: Hi, Thanks Irina! I'm Tomás Assenza. I study here too at the National Technological University and I work as an auxiliar teacher at the Algorithms and Data Structure subject.
I'll talk about the last topic of the presentation. This topic is very similar to the last section that Irina talked about. So let's begin.

How do we work on IoT?

???
Irina talked before of what's an API and why do companies try to empower users giving the chance to generate new products. The interesting thing here is that the industry isn't selling an IoT specifical product because they're selling the possibility to generate them. This is like the difference between (pasar de diapositiva mientras se dice) selling a lego, or a pre-build toy

???
There are a lot of examples of hardware and software provided to generate IoT projects.
One of these examples could be the Google' products. They're currently trying really hard to generate open-source solutions for developers interested in the area. An example of these is the AIY Voice Kit.

???
AIY means Artificial Intelligence Yourself, and the Voice Kit consists of a cardboard box with a speaker, a microphone, and a hat that connects to a Raspberry PI and lets the developer to use voice recognition to create software with its own hardware.
With this type of device, the developer could use an API like Snowboy.

???
Snowboy is an open-source software that let the developer use a "weak-word" for the activation of something. For example, we could say "Play the song!" and the device should activate the software that plays the song.

This is the last section of our presentation. We were thinking with Iri and Vale what could say about projects related to our career. Then we realized that it was better to prepare something than to talk of something abstract. So, for the fireworks, we prepared an integrated system with a Raspberry PI, a Voice Kit and the Snowboy API to play a song. I'll show a second camera with the finished project.

We used:

* Snowboy -> Software
* RemarkJS -> Presentation
]

???
So, as we said, we used a Raspberry PI connected to a Voice kit for the hardware and Snowboy for the software.
We didn't want to make a presentation with a lot of things on the screen because we wanted to make focus on the topics and ideas. So we used a presentation software called RemarkJS that makes nice presentations that focus on few text.
