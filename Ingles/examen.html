Hi, I'm Valentina Ducasse. We've been working on this presentation about how's Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence inmerssed on society, and what is the posibility to work on projects bassed on these topics as Information Systems Engineers

# Agenda

1. **Introduction**
2. How does it work
3. Can we work on it?


???
Those are the topics that we'll talk about. I'll start with an Introduction explaining what's Internet of Things and how does it started to be used in society.

Internet of Things is a concept that, in most cases, involves technological objects that weren't automated and can be updated to be "Smart". We can say that an objects is smart when it start to work similary to a computer, often they even have the capability to connect to Internet and that's when this idea can be applied.

A device that has Internet of Things usually have sensors, software, hardware and other technologies with the objective of connect and share data with devices all over the world. With that hardware, it can envolve Artificial Intelligence most commonly by the use of voice recognition or object and pattern detection with an integrated camera.

Internet of Things appeared for the first time when internet even didn't exist! Coca-Cola designed in 1982 a vending machine that used a board to detect the internal leds of the machine and used Arpanet (a precursor of internet) to send data to the main computer.

The funny thing of the creation of this device is that Mike Kazar (who's one of the creators) never used the machine except for trying to test if it worked. (PASAR DIAPOSITIVA ANTES DE DECIR ESTO) He even said that he never liked Coke!

# How does it work


???
Now Irina's going that we talked about what's IoT, Irina is goint to show how does Internet of Things works and what types of projects exists

Hi! My name's Irina Argañaras. Today I'm going to talk about the technical part of IoT. As Valentina said, Internet of Things involves software and hardware to generate a product, but there are some technologies that are usually used on this type of projects.

All the projects in the IoT area implements simillar functions, so, to help developers to work with similar technologies, the companies that generate IoT solutions usually gives them APIs to work with their products.

???
An API is something between the technical development that the programmer do, and the product that te company offers. In other words, the APIs help the Systems Engineer to create IoT software using existing technology.

???
As an example, we can have an IoT system to control the thermostat temperature. To do that, the IoT system can conect to the OpenWeather API, and obtain information about the weather. Also can use long term data with the preferences of the user, to offer an unique service to each user.
Also, the companies of publics services could have the ability to analyze customer IoT data with smart thermostats in order to optimize the system on a large scale.

In IoT there are a lot of projects with different costs. An example of an expensive projects could be a smart home (pasar diapositiva), or the famous "Spot" robot (pasar diapositiva).

But all the projects needs to be expensive. Some companies (like Google or Microsoft) started to build hardware for open-source implementations letting developers from all the world work with IoT projects involving Artificial Intelligence with less than fifty dollars.

There are a lot of devices that helps to implements IoT for engineers, or even enthusiasts. They usually work as a normal computer with it's own operating system. A good example of this type of device is the Raspberry PI that is a low-cost computer with similar capabilities to a cheap smartphone. It even has it's own recommended operating system called Raspbian.

So, in other words this extends the IoT concept to low-cost areas. It's a matter of fact that there are a a lot of expensive projects like a pre-build smart-homes, but there's a possibility to build IoT projects using other technologies designed to build very innovative ideas such as a voice detection system for turning lights on and off or a motion detection system for intrusion detection.
