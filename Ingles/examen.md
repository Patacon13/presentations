# Introduction

* What's IoT? How does it envolves AI?


???

PARTE 1

Internet of Things is a concept that, in most cases, involves technological objects that weren't automated and can be updated to be "Smart". We can say that an objects is smart when it start to work similary to a computer, often they even have the capability to connect to Internet and that's when this idea can be applied.

A device that has Internet of Things usually have sensors, software, hardware and other technologies with the objective of connect and share data with devices all over the world. With that hardware, it can envolve Artificial Intelligence most commonly by the use of voice recognition or object and pattern detection with an integrated camera.

* History

???

PARTE 2

Internet of Things appeared for the first time when internet even didn't exist! Coca-Cola designed in 1982 a vending machine that used a board to detect the internal leds of the machine and used Arpanet (a precursor of internet) to send data to the main computer.

The funny thing of the creation of this device is that Mike Kazar (who's one of the creators) never used the machine except for trying to test if it worked. He said that he never liked Coke!
